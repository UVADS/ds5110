    "### Spark Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "One benefit of Spark is the ability to scale computation by adding more machines and running in cluster mode\n",
    "\n",
    "The *workers (aka executors)* receive code and data chunks and do the processing, sending results back to driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *driver* is in charge of coordinating the workers\n",
    "\n",
    "Driver + Workers = Spark application\n",
    "\n",
    "### Driver\n",
    "\n",
    "`main()` method of program runs on driver\n",
    "\n",
    "Converts program into tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Converts into logical *directed acyclic graph* (DAG) of operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Coordinates scheduling of tasks on executors (like a manager)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Executors\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the individual tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Launch at start of application and run for lifetime of app\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide in-memory (RAM) storage for RDDs\n",
    "\n",
    "Using RAM speeds up computation versus slower disk\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cluster Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "External service where the Spark application runs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Spark is packaged with the Standalone cluster manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manages the resources between Spark applications.  \n",
    "Can manage queues if there is more demand than resources for executors.\n",

    "It is possible to cache data in RAM for speedup (avoiding recompute).  \n",
