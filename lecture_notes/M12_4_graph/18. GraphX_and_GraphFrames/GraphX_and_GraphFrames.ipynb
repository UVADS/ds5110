    "### GraphX Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "`GraphX` is the Spark API for graphs and graph-parallel computation.  \n",
    "It combines ETL, exploratory data analysis, and iterative graph computation into one system.\n",
    "\n",
    "`GraphX` includes a library of graph algorithms including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- PageRank\n",
    "- Connected components / strongly connected components\n",
    "- Label propagation\n",
    "- SVD++\n",
    "- Triangle count\n",
    "\n",
    "### GraphX Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "`GraphX` extends the Spark RDD with a *Resilient Distributed Property Graph*, which is a *multigraph*.  Each edge and vertex has defined properties, and parallel edges allow multiple relationships between the same vertices.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, imagine two airports with multiple flights between the airports.  The airports are the vertices, the flights are the edges, and the construct is a multigraph.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Like RDDs, property graphs are immutable, distributed, and fault-tolerant.  Each partition of a graph can be recreated on a different machine in the event of failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classes `VertexRDD` and `EdgeRDD` extend RDDs.  Their purpose is to provide functionality for graph computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Property Graph**\n",
    "\n",
    "The property graph below shows collaborators on the GraphX project, and their relationships with one another.  The Vertex Table holds identifiers, usernames, and titles.  The Edge Table holds the relationships.  For example, Prof Franklin (*SrcId 5*) advises R Xin (*DstId 3*)."
