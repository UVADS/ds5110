## Journaling Instructions

The purpose of this exercise is to track your learning and growth through this course.  
You will add an entry for each Module (ideally on a weekly basis).  
You will submit your journal over the course of the term and it will grow with your new entries.  

Each entry should answer some or all of these questions:
- What were some things you learned in the module?
- What do you think were the most important concepts?
- What was challenging for you? How can you learn it better?
- Which parts did you enjoy?

Positive feedback is also fine (e.g., Exercise X, Part Y wasn't clear) but negative criticism should be avoided.

Each entry should:
- Use full sentences to show good writing and clear thought process
- Be limited to one or two paragraphs (it should be fairly brief)

File format: Use a Word doc or similar. Recycle the same file throughout the course.
