NOTE: You should NOT need to link your personal cloud account.

#### Twitter API setup details
In the application, Twitter asks you to describe the use of this account. You should write:

*I will do an assignment for my UVA data science course where I will parse tweets and count hashtags over a window of time.  
The results will be submitted to the instructor only. I will not use or save any data outside the scope outlined above.*

The next few questions ask if you will do analysis, post with the API, share anything with government agency, etc.  
Say no to all questions, as this is just a simple homework assignment.
