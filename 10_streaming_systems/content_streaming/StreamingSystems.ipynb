    "Streaming systems include *microbatch* implementations such as *Spark Streaming* discussed later.  In microbatch, a batch processing engine is repeatedly called at a fairly high frequency, such as every 500 microseconds.  Each microbatch consists of a chunk of data, formed from a window processing time.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Tables** are data *at rest,* reflecting the data at a point in time.  Think of tables in a relational database.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Streams** are data *in motion*.  They capture the evolution of data over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregating a stream of updates over time produces a table.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Observing changes to a table over time produces a stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MapReduce Viewed as Streams and Tables**\n",
    "\n",
    "The stages look like this:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consume a table of input data, such as sentences from a corpus\n",
    "2. Preprocess the input data into key/value form.  Preprocessing transforms the data into a stream.\n",
    "3. Consume the key/value pairs, outputting modified key/value pairs in form\n",
    "(word, 1). These are streams.\n",
    "4. Shuffle the data, sending key/value pairs w same key to same worker.\n",
    "5. Reduce by key, which is an aggregation\n",
    "6. Persist the data, producing a table\n",
    "\n",
    "The process starts with a table and ends with a table, using streams in between to transform the data.\n",

    "**Transformations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformations tell us what the pipeline is computing.  There are two kinds:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Nongrouping* transformations take a stream as input and produce a new stream as output.  Examples include `filter`, `map`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Grouping* transformation take a stream as input and perform aggregation, which transforms data into a table.  An example is `ReduceByKey`.\n",

    "\n",
    "The purpose of persisting tables is to capture data that otherwise would vanish.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Durability upon Interruption\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming systems are supposed to run forever, but this isn't realistic in practice.  Interruptions happen for many reasons, such as machine failure, planned maintenance, code changes, and bad commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Persistent state helps the system to recover from an interruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "For expensive, complex pipelines, can use *checkpointing* to periodically save results.  In event of failure, the system only loses data since the last checkpoint.  Persistence must be strategic, since it must be assumed that data through the system cannot be reloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correctness and Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "By persisting the necessary intermediate quantities, the system the can recover from an interruption.  It is important to save just what is necessary, since extra data just takes up space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Raw Grouping versus Incremental Combining**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Raw grouping* appends each new element.  This can require massive storage costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Incremental combining* will incrementally compute and checkpoint an intermediate result.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Running Average*  \n",
    "As an example, if we are interested in the average of a vector of values, it will be more efficient to store a running sum and count (incremental combining) than to store all of the values (raw grouping).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Histogram*  \n",
    "A histogram will be a more complex accumulator than a running average, but it provides a better description of the distribution than the mean.  To persist a histogram, store a running count for each bucket range.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Parallelization*  \n",
    "Parallelization can be used to optimize aggregation.  Specifically, subgroups of data can be distributed across multiple machines, with each machine computing a partial aggregate.\n",

    "\n",
    "Conversion attribution is used in the advertising technology (AdTech) space to provide concrete feedback on the efficacy of advertisements.  It is a common use case for streaming systems.  In the ideal situation, a desired outcome (consumer purchases a product) can be precisely traced back to an advertisement.  In practice, this task is often challenging for reasons such as a complex path between the advertisement (a.k.a. the *impression*) and the outcome, and *attribution fraud*.  \n",
    "\n",

With infinite datasets, care must to taken to recover needed data for correct results.  This is solved by  checkpointing persistent state over time."

    "### Event Time versus Processing Time\n",
    "\n",
    "For any data processing system, there are two times of interest:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *event time*, which is the time at which events actually occurred\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *processing time*, which is the time at which events are observed by the system\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally these times would always coincide (black dashed line in **Processing Time vs Event Time figure below**), but in practice we observe a red curve.  For example, a user might use an app offline in airplane mode.  When the app switches back online, it uploads user statistics to the system for processing.  This causes the processing time to occur after the event time, known as *processing-time lag.*  *Event-time skew* measures the time between when the event actually occurred and when it was processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The degree of event-time skew can be affected by several factors including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- shared resource limitations like network congestion, shared CPU in a nondedicated environment  \n",
    "- software causes such as distributed system logic\n",
    "- variance in throughput\n",

    "### Batching Data and Windowing\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with infinite datasets, processing systems use *windowing*, which chops the dataset into finite pieces along temporal boundaries.  Many systems (including Spark Streaming) define these temporal boundaries using processing time, as this is easier than defining by event time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forming windows by processing time can lead to incorrect conclusions in the context of their event times.  From the lens of event times, they might arrive for processing out of order.  Further, there may not be certainty when all of the events from a given time window have all arrived for processing (there could be late data).  Streaming systems like `Apache Beam` aim at providing event time correctness.\n",

    "A limitation with this approach is that delayed data will be included in the incorrect bucket, due to processing-time lag. To account for the lag, the system could attempt to:\n",

    "\n",
    "When event times and processing times coincide, things are straightforward.  However, when event data can arrive late, the problem becomes tricky.  How do we know when to close a time window?  This motivates the concept of *watermarks*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Watermarks are temporal notions of input completeness in the event-time domain.  It makes the statement that all data with event times `<T` have been observed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes watermarks are exact, but other times the best we can do is design approximate (heuristic) watermarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Watermarks work together with triggers: when the watermark reaches a given level, the trigger fires, producing results. That is, output for one or more windows is materialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oftentimes, it makes sense to provide a bound on how late an event can arrive.  This allows the system to close the window after the fixed period, dropping any points exceeding the bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Watermark Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "The watermark illustration below shows an example of a perfect watermark and a heuristic watermark.  In each case, the x-axis shows the event time domain sliced into fixed window panes of 2 minutes. The y-axis shows the processing time domain.  The circles denote data points, with their values inside.  The curves are the watermarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a window is closed (with time denoted on the y-axis), results can be reported.  The numbers in yellow denote the values reported from each window.  For the perfect watermark, a value of 14 is reported for the 12:00-12:02 event time window a bit before 12:09.  This contrasts with the value of 5 reported for that same window using the heuristic watermark.  This is due to the red data point with value 9 arriving very late; the heuristic watermark missed that point, and it was ignored.  One advantage, however, is the earlier reporting time at 12:06. Thus, **the heuristic watermark faces a tradeoff between correctness and latency**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real systems, perfect watermarks are often impractical.  The more that is known about the source, the better the heuristic that can be designed, resulting in fewer late data points.\n",
