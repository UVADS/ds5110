3,"Some franchise owners dock hours. Pros Good discounts on the food. Cons The location where I was working, in North Fresno near Riverpark Mall, was ran by the owner s father who treated the female staff with contempt and derision. Would yell at the staff, in front of the guests, if they didn t exactly follow his formula for making the sandwiches (even when the staff were trying to fulfill the special requests of the guests). He would clock out the closers (with or without their knowledge) before they were done with their tasks, and ask employees to stay an hour or two past the end of their shift, but would not pay them for their time.","['lunch', 'best sandwich', 'entertainment', 'restaurants', 'sub', 'arizona', 'quick', 'social networks', 'washington', 'catering reno', 'establishment', 'nevada', 'restaurant', 'wraps', 'qsr', 'small business', 'meal takeaway', 'hospitality', 'sandwich', 'franchise', 'seminars', 'deli', 'point of interest', 'sandwiches', 'port', 'other', 'food', 'party trays reno', 'service', 'entrepeneur', 'franchises', 'fast food', 'grillers', 'griller', 'salad', 'management', 'businesses', 'self employed', 'wrap', 'submarine', 'delis', 'lake tahoe', 'boss', 'salads', 'trade shows', 'eating places', 'franchising', 'reno', 'subs', 'phoenix']"

10,"Bushs chicken..more writeups then checks Pros Paid weekly. Nice visor If you have another job they ll work with your schedule Cons This is for belton 1 near the hs. Stuck on counter and drink duty..no tips because customers are too cheap. Carhops are paid way more. I signed up for that but it was only given to veterans. Unrealistic expectations for closing on time. As front of house, you clean the restaurant part, the bathrooms and are still expected to serve customers until 9 00pm..it gets dirty again just silly. Some unrealistic time for getting your duty done and yet u still get wrote up. Why even clean well You might as well work half butt. Most of my writeups were for this. How does 1 person do everything for the front while the carhops get to work more as a team at closing time. Little odd how they run it. I worked at sonic and was only given 1 write up in 8 months and not for cleaning up at the end..just amateur. Here 6 in 2 months. Too many chiefs not enough Indians. I HIGHLY don t recommend working if you re considered cheap labor like I was. Got hired somewhere else knowing I was gonna be fired eventually. There is literally no business in the restaurant only outside. They re looking for the cheapest labor but they are the quickest to be written up. Other restaurants truly value their lowest paid workers.

Sometimes days could get a little overwhelming during crawfish season, but at the end of the day, you definitely feel accomplished. It s very apparent that they truly appreciate the people that work for them. Thats the biggest Pro any job can have. Anytime I stop by to pick up a po boy or some boiled shrimp, they always treat me like family. I can t say that for any other job that I ve ever had since then. What I think I liked best about the job was the sense that we were really a team. Everybody came together and worked as efficiently as possible. If you aren t a team player or a hard worker this gig probably isn t for you. If you are, however, I can assure you that this will be a rewarding experience.

310,"I m a server working at a restaurant where management cares about nothing but profits Pros Well the only plus I can think of is that it is a job, and as an employee you get free tap water. Cons They do not hire hosts, bussers, dishwashers or anyone to handle to go orders. Yep as a server in between helping tables you wash have to go wash dishes otherwise your guests won t have clean dishes for their meals. Servers wash every single dish including dishes cooks used for prepping or food storage. You are only allowed to drink tap water. I never recieved an orientation going over company rules or polices, never filled out a W4 or I9 when hired. I recieved maybe 20 minutes of training in total with a full restaurant my trainer did her best within those 20 minutes but was incredibly busy (only her and one other server working at the time). On my first day I was scolded several times because I failed to do things I was never shown how to do. The manager sits in office staring at a video feed of the restaurant so she can yell at you if you do anything wrong, despite the fact that you were never told how to do things properly the yelling you recieve doesn t even how to do things the correct way. If you ring in an order wrong or there is an error you as the server are responsible to pay out of your pocket to correct the error. They also have found a loophole in California law so that the company pays you under the minimum wage (California law states servers are supposed to make minimum wage unlike some other states). I ve had some employers that treated me unfairly and I can t speak for all Buffalo Wings Rings locations but this location in Modesto California treats employees worse than any other employer I ve worked for. Looking for new job that knows how to treat employees like humans. Also kitchen, prep area, walk in and freezer are kept extremely dirty. A majority of the time the restaurants food handling procedures would fail a health inspection (ex. Prepping raw chicken right next to dirty dishes and trash on the same table within a foot or two of each other).

Stuck on counter and drink duty..no tips because customers are too cheap. Carhops are paid way more. I signed up for that but it was only given to veterans. Unrealistic expectations for closing on time. As front of house, you clean the restaurant part, the bathrooms and are still expected to serve customers until 9 00pm..it gets dirty again just silly. Some unrealistic time for getting your duty done and yet u still get wrote up. Why even clean well You might as well work half butt. Most of my writeups were for this. How does 1 person do everything for the front while the carhops get to work more as a team at closing time. Little odd how they run it. I worked at sonic and was only given 1 write up in 8 months and not for cleaning up at the end..just amateur. Here 6 in 2 months. Too many chiefs not enough Indians. I HIGHLY don t recommend working if you re considered cheap labor like I was. Got hired somewhere else knowing I was gonna be fired eventually.
